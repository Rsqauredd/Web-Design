		<p>SpongeBob: Oh! Hello? Hello?</p>
		<p>Patrick: SpongeBob, did you get your net back?</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!</p>
		<p>Patrick: Oh, sorry. [hangs up. The phone rings again] Did you get your net yet?</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. [hangs up. The phone rings again]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Hello?</p>
		<p>Patrick: SpongeBob, I found your net!</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: What! Really?</p>
		<p>Patrick: Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. [looks out his window and notices Patrick running around with a jellyfish net]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net. [gets in bed] Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday. [his eyes widen. Scene cuts to morning. Patrick walks up to SpongeBob's pineapple]</p>
		<p>Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [sighs] No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net? [Patrick laughs then stops]</p>
		<p>Patrick: No. [SpongeBob laughs]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.</p>
		<p>Patrick: A present? What is it?</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [pulls out a bear with a microphone in its hand] It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.</p>
		<p>Patrick: Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.

		<p>[Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away]</p>
		<p>Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
		Patrick: See for yourself.</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [his body is facedown but his face come out and reads the award] "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"</p>
		<p>Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.</p>
		<p>Patrick: But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?</p>
		<p>Patrick: Ice cream!</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Exactly!</p>
		<p>Patrick: I can find it. Is it in here?</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet.</p>
		<p>Patrick: I want an award. [starts to cry]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [has two 1st place ribbons in his eyes] Aww, Patrick, don't cry.</p>
		<p>[Patrick starts sobbing loudly going away from the awards]
		SpongeBob: You'll get an award one day.</p>
		<p>Patrick: I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: But you're Patrick... [jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars] Star. You can do anything you want.</p>
		<p>Patrick: That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.</p>
		<p>Patrick: Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!</p>

		<p>Muscular Guy #1: [being impatient for the patty] Where's my Krabby Patty?</p>
		<p>Squidward: Right here, muscleboy.</p>
		<p>Muscular Guy #1: It's about time. [before he takes a bite, the patty sheds a tear]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [screams and grabs the patty] I won't let you do this to Patty.</p>
		<p>Squidward: SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby—</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [sitting under the grill] Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved. [opens up the patty] Amazing.</p>
		<p>Squidward: [snickering] What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it? [continues snickering]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Great idea. [runs off]</p>
		<p>Squidward: [sighs] I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: [gives a Krabby Patty to Muscular Guy #1] Enjoy, sir.</p>
		<p>Muscular Guy #1: Can I eat this one? [lifts the top bun up off to reveal a shoe in the Patty] Hey, how'd they know? I loved grilled shoe. [cut to SpongeBob's house where Patty is cooking on the grill]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us. [small explosion] Fire! [alarm bell rings. SpongeBob pants] Fire! Fire!</p>
		<p>Gary: [by a fire extinguisher] Meow. [puts out the fire. SpongeBob stops panting]</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now. [doorbell rings] Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell. [opens the door]</p>
		<p>Patrick: [lifts SpongeBob up] SpongeBob, how about another game of— [ties SpongeBob in a knot] tie your best buddy in knots. [lies down] My turn.</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. [unties himself] I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.</p>

		<p>[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick are hitting a plastic cup with a stick, feeling bored.]</p>

		<p>[Patrick hits the cup with the stick.]</p>
		<p>Patrick: Now you. [gives SpongeBob the stick]</p>

		<p>Patrick: [sighs] Yes, SpongeBob?</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with... [holds out two sticks] two sticks?</p>
		<p>[Patrick's head buffs up and snatches the sticks from SpongeBob's hands.]</p>
		<p>Patrick: Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!</p>
		<p>SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing "Stick in a Cup."</p>
